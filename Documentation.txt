Vaya: Your Local Healthcare Connection
1. Project Overview
Project Name: Vaya 

Tagline: Connecting You to Care, Right Where You Are. 

Vision: Vaya aims to simplify healthcare access for patients in smaller towns like Motihari, Bihar, by directly connecting them with trusted private clinics and doctors. It offers digital convenience for appointments and records and leverages AI for smart doctor recommendations. 

Current Stage: The project is an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) web application, establishing foundational features for clinic/doctor registration, patient-side doctor discovery, and an AI-powered symptom checker. 

Key Features (Implemented in MVP):

Clinic/Doctor Registration Form: A web form allowing private clinics/doctors to submit their details to Vaya. This process automatically creates a 

CustomUser account for the doctor and a linked Doctor profile. By default, doctors are 

is_approved=False upon registration, requiring administrator activation.

Doctor Profile Management (Admin Panel): Vaya administrators (superusers or permitted staff) can manage (add, edit, approve) doctor and specialty profiles through the Django Admin interface. This includes linking doctors to 

CustomUser accounts and setting their is_approved status.


Patient-facing Doctor Listing: A public web page where patients can view approved doctors, with search functionality by name and filtering by specialty.


Custom User Model: A flexible CustomUser model extends Django's AbstractUser, allowing for additional patient-specific fields (phone_number, date_of_birth, gender) and serving as the base for all user accounts (admins, patients, doctors).


AI-Powered Symptom Checker & Doctor Recommendation: An integrated feature allowing users to input symptoms. The system then uses the Groq API (Llama3 model) to provide a general understanding, suggest relevant medical specialties, and recommend approved doctors from the database based on these specialties. It includes disclaimers and handles non-medical queries gracefully. 

Appointment Booking System: Patients can view a specific doctor's available DoctorSlots and book appointments. The system prevents double-booking and manages the availability of slots. Doctors can confirm or cancel pending appointments. 

Patient Dashboard: A personalized dashboard for patients to view their profile, upcoming and past appointments, and access their uploaded medical reports.

Doctor Dashboard/Portal: A dedicated dashboard for approved doctors to manage their profile, view/manage their specific DoctorSlots, see upcoming and past appointments, and view/upload relevant patient reports. 

Digital Report Management: Allows patients to upload their own medical reports and doctors to upload reports for specific patients. Reports can be downloaded from respective dashboards.

2. Getting Started (Local Development Setup)
This section guides a new developer through setting up the Vaya project on their local machine. 

2.1. Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed on your system: 

Python 3.9+ (Python 3.9.6 is currently used) 

pip (Python's package installer, usually comes with Python) 

Git (for cloning the repository) 

2.2. Local Setup Steps

Follow these steps in your terminal, starting from your desired project folder location: 

Clone the Repository: 

Bash
git clone <your-repo-url-here> # Replace with your actual GitHub URL
cd healthcare_app_motihari
Create and Activate a Virtual Environment: 

It's crucial to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies and avoid conflicts with other Python projects. 

Bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
# venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
# source venv/bin/activate
You should see 

(venv) prefixing your terminal prompt, indicating the virtual environment is active. 

Install Python Dependencies: 

Install all required Python libraries using pip. 

Bash
pip install Django psycopg2-binary
# `psycopg2-binary` is for PostgreSQL. 
# If you want to strictly use SQLite for development, you can just run `pip install Django`. [cite: 17]
# However, the current setup is ready for PostgreSQL. [cite: 18]
# Django uses SQLite by default if no other database is configured.
Database Migrations (Crucial Step!): 


Apply the initial database migrations. This creates all necessary tables in your 

db.sqlite3 file (or your configured database). 

Important: If setting up for the first time, or if encountering InconsistentMigrationHistory or OperationalError: no such table errors, perform a clean migration reset: 

Delete the database file: 

rm db.sqlite3 (if using SQLite) 

Delete all app-specific migration files: 

Bash
rm users/migrations/0*.py
rm doctors/migrations/0*.py
# Repeat for ai_assistant if you had migrations there
Ensure 

AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'users.CustomUser' is correctly set in config/settings.py before running makemigrations. 

Now, run the migrations: 

Bash
python manage.py makemigrations users
python manage.py makemigrations doctors
python manage.py makemigrations ai_assistant # If you add models to ai_assistant later
python manage.py migrate
Create a Django Superuser: 

You'll need a superuser account to access the Django Admin panel and manage initial data (like specialties and approving doctors). 

Bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
Follow the prompts to set up your admin username, email, and password. 

Run the Development Server: 

Bash
python manage.py runserver
This will start the Django development server, usually accessible at 

http://127.0.0.1:8000/. 

2.3. Initial Data Setup (via Django Admin)

After running the server and creating a superuser: 

Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ and log in with your superuser credentials. 

Add Specialties: Go to Doctors -> Specialties and add common medical specialties (e.g., "General Physician", "Pediatrician", "Gynecologist", "Dermatologist"). These are required for doctors to select during registration. 

Add Doctors (or approve registered ones):

Manual Addition: Go to Doctors -> Doctors. You can add doctor profiles manually, linking them to an existing 

CustomUser account. If the doctor doesn't have a login yet, create a 

CustomUser for them under Authentication and Authorization -> Users, then link it here. Ensure 

is_approved is checked for doctors to appear on the public listing.

Approving Registered Clinics: When a clinic registers via the frontend form, a Doctor profile and a CustomUser account are created with is_approved=False and is_active=False respectively. As the admin, you will need to go to 

Doctors -> Doctors, find the newly registered clinic, edit it, and check the is_approved box. You might also want to activate their 

CustomUser account under Authentication and Authorization -> Users by checking is_active if they are meant to log in.

4. Key Components & Logic
4.1. Custom User Model (users app)

CustomUser: Extends Django's AbstractUser, serving as the base for all user accounts (admins, patients, doctors). It includes additional patient-specific fields: 

phone_number, date_of_birth, and gender. 


4.2. Doctor & Clinic Management (doctors app)

Specialty Model: Represents medical specialties (e.g., "Pediatrician") with a simple name field. 

Doctor Model:

Linked to 

CustomUser via a OneToOneField, intended for the doctor's login. 

specialties is a ManyToManyField to Specialty, allowing doctors to be associated with multiple specialties. 

Includes fields for clinic details, contact information, qualifications, and an 

is_approved flag. 

DoctorSlot Model: Represents specific, pre-defined time slots a doctor makes available for appointments. Key fields include doctor, date, start_time, end_time, and is_available. It ensures uniqueness for a given doctor, date, and time range.

Appointment Model: Links a patient (CustomUser) to a doctor for a specific appointment_slot (DoctorSlot). It tracks status (pending, confirmed, completed, cancelled) and appointment_type.

Report Model: Handles medical reports, linking patient and optionally doctor. Includes title, description, report_file, uploaded_at, and report_date.

ClinicRegistrationForm (doctors/forms.py):

A Django 

ModelForm based on the Doctor model. 

Includes additional fields (

username, password, confirm_password) to create a new CustomUser account for the doctor during registration. 

The 

save() method is overridden to handle CustomUser creation, linking it to the Doctor instance, and saving ManyToManyFields for specialties. 

New 

CustomUser and Doctor profiles are set to is_active=False and is_approved=False by default, requiring admin activation. 

AppointmentBookingForm (doctors/forms.py): Now uses a ModelChoiceField to dynamically display and select DoctorSlot objects, ensuring appointments are tied to specific available slots.

DoctorProfileEditForm (doctors/forms.py): Allows doctors to update their profile details, including general availability fields (working_days, start_time, end_time).

DoctorSlotForm (doctors/forms.py): Facilitates doctors in creating new available time slots.

ReportUploadForm (doctors/forms.py): Used for both patient and doctor report uploads.

doctor_list View (doctors/views.py): Fetches Doctor profiles that have is_approved=True. It uses 

prefetch_related('specialties') for efficient retrieval and includes search by doctor name and filtering by specialty. 

register_clinic View (doctors/views.py): Handles clinic registration form display and submission. It saves the form, creates 

CustomUser and Doctor objects, and uses Django's messages framework for feedback. 

book_appointment View (doctors/views.py): Manages appointment booking, linking to DoctorSlots and updating their availability.

confirm_appointment / cancel_appointment Views (doctors/views.py): Allow doctors (or patients for cancel) to manage appointment statuses and update associated DoctorSlot availability.

doctor_dashboard View (doctors/views.py): Displays doctor-specific information, appointments, and relevant reports.

doctor_slot_management View (doctors/views.py): Provides an interface for doctors to manage their specific time slots.

doctor_upload_report / patient_upload_report Views (doctors/views.py): Handle the logic for uploading reports by doctors (for a patient) or by patients (for themselves).

4.3. User Authentication & Patient Management (users app)

PatientSignUpForm (users/forms.py): Extends UserCreationForm to include custom patient fields (first_name, last_name, phone_number, date_of_birth, gender) during registration.

PatientProfileEditForm (users/forms.py): Allows patients to edit their profile details.

patient_signup View (users/views.py): Handles patient registration, using PatientSignUpForm and providing feedback messages.

custom_login_redirect View (users/views.py): A critical view that redirects logged-in users to doctor_dashboard (if approved doctor), patient_dashboard (if patient), or landing_page (if doctor profile is pending approval).

patient_dashboard View (users/views.py): Displays a patient's profile, upcoming/past appointments, and personal reports.

patient_profile_edit View (users/views.py): Enables patients to update their profile information.

4.4. AI Assistant (ai_assistant app)

SymptomCheckerForm (ai_assistant/forms.py): Simple form for users to input symptoms.

symptom_checker View (ai_assistant/views.py):

Integrates with the Groq API (Llama3 model) for AI responses.

Crafts prompts to request structured JSON responses from the AI.

Parses AI responses to extract understanding, suggested medical specialties, and a disclaimer.

Uses suggested specialties to query the Doctor model and recommend approved doctors.

Handles non-medical queries by providing a specific message.

Note: API key is currently hardcoded; for production, move to environment variables.

4.5. Admin Customizations (admin.py in users and doctors)

users/admin.py: Registers CustomUser with UserAdmin for basic management. 

doctors/admin.py:

DoctorAdmin: Customizes how Doctor objects are displayed and managed, including list_display (using display_specialties method), list_filter (by specialties and is_approved status), and a custom approve_doctors action. 

Registers 

Specialty, Appointment, Report, and DoctorSlot models for admin management.

5. Data Management & Security
Database: Currently uses SQLite (db.sqlite3) for local development. For production deployment, a robust relational database like PostgreSQL is highly recommended for scalability and reliability. 


Data Privacy (DPDP Act, 2023): As a healthcare application handling sensitive personal data, strict adherence to India's Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDP Act, 2023) is paramount.  Key principles to embed in development include:

Consent: Obtaining explicit, informed, and unambiguous consent for data collection and processing. 

Purpose Limitation: Data used only for specified, consented purposes. 

Data Minimization: Collecting only necessary data. 

Security: Robust technical and organizational measures to protect data. 

User Rights: Handling user requests regarding their data (access, correction, erasure). 

Security Best Practices (Implemented):

CSRF Protection: Django's {% csrf_token %} is used in all POST forms. 

Password Hashing: Django automatically hashes and salts passwords securely. 

Input Validation: Django Forms provide built-in validation. 

Security Best Practices (For Production):

HTTPS: Essential for encrypting all production traffic. 

Regular Security Audits: Conduct periodic assessments. 

Access Control: Implement granular role-based access control. 

6. Deployment
Current: Local development server (python manage.py runserver). 

Future: For production, consider cloud platforms like Render (familiar), AWS (EC2, RDS, S3, Lambda), Google Cloud Platform (App Engine, Cloud SQL), or Microsoft Azure. These offer scalability, enhanced security, and robust databases. Familiarity with Docker will be invaluable for consistent deployments.

8. Troubleshooting Common Issues





InconsistentMigrationHistory or OperationalError: no such table: 

Cause: Database schema out of sync with models. 

Fix: (For development ONLY) Delete db.sqlite3 and 0*.py files in app's migrations/ directories. Then, run python manage.py makemigrations <app_name> for each affected app, followed by python manage.py migrate. Remember to 

createsuperuser again. 

FieldError: Invalid field name(s) given in select_related: 'specialty'. Choices are: user: 

Cause: Using select_related() with a ManyToManyField. 

Fix: Use prefetch_related() instead for ManyToManyFields (e.g., Doctor.objects.prefetch_related('specialties')). 

NameError: name 'redirect' is not defined: 

Cause: Missing import for redirect in a Django view. 

Fix: Add from django.shortcuts import render, redirect to the top of the views.py file. 

CSRF verification failed: 

Cause: Missing {% csrf_token %} in a POST form or incorrect browser cookie settings. 

Fix: Ensure {% csrf_token %} is present inside every <form method="POST"> tag. 

Form Field Rendering Issues (e.g., styling not applying): 

Cause: Django renders raw HTML input; CSS selectors might be too specific. 

Fix: Ensure CSS selectors are broad enough or apply custom widgets with attrs in forms.py to add specific CSS classes or IDs.
